# OilPriceX

I have developed a web application that I am excited to showcase on GitHub. This app features a dynamic combination of backend and frontend technologies, resulting in a seamless user experience. Let me walk you through its architecture and components.

### Backend Implementation:
The backend of the application is powered by a combination of Apache 2.4.54, MySQL 8.0.31, and PHP 8.0.26. These technologies were seamlessly integrated and configured using the WampServer web development environment. This backend setup ensures efficient data processing and storage, enabling the app to provide fast and reliable performance.

### Frontend Implementation:
For the frontend, I utilized the Bootstrap 5 framework, complemented by the engaging Darkly theme. To tailor the app's appearance and user interface to my vision, I incorporated custom CSS code. This code not only adapts the layout but also fine-tunes specific elements of the pages, ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing experience.

To enhance user interactions, I integrated JavaScript. This scripting language is responsible for form validation, checking user-entered data, and displaying informative messages if incorrect information is provided in the form fields. This interaction layer adds another level of user-friendliness to the application.

### File Structure:
The application boasts a well-organized file structure, designed to maintain clarity and efficiency. Below are the key folders within the project:

- assets: This directory houses subfolders named documents and images. These contain the necessary PDF files for terms of use and images that enrich the website's visual content.
- config: Here, you'll find an INI file containing the database connection details. Additionally, I've included PHP code that extracts these connection details from the INI file, ensuring secure and efficient database interactions.
- controllers: This folder contains PHP files that orchestrate data flow and communication among various components, particularly those linked to database operations.
- css: The custom CSS code in this directory fine-tunes layout elements and complements the Darkly Bootstrap theme.
- includes: This section holds HTML and PHP files responsible for consistent header and footer rendering across all pages.
- js: JavaScript files in this folder handle form validation by checking input values and providing instant feedback to users.
- model: The DbClient class in this directory facilitates smooth database interactions, handling data insertion, deletion, and updates.
- views: This is where the code resides for rendering the actual web pages that users interact with.
